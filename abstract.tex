While the halting problem is proven to be undecidable in conventional purely functional programming languages,
it's possible to design a Turing-complete purely functional programming language
by breaking some fundamental properties of conventional purely functional programming languages
such that the problem of implementing an interpreter which will finish running for any input program is unsolved.
